I'm just another thing for you. 
Let me tell you the pain was beating on me like a drum. 
Obviously you are the best thing ever been mine.
Vows, so glad you were around.
Elevator button sounds odd in my ear.
You walked out from everything we had.
Our crystal clear is beautiful like single rain drop.
Until you came back to me with another mind.

This is just a text. Seriously it's only text. There's no Hidden Message, believe me.
